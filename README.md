# Then I will.
### A twitter based novel generator, made for NaNoGenMo 2013.

This little experiment comes after a couple of weeks playing with the Twitter API search, and looking for things to do with it. NaNoGenMo gave me the idea of using that to create something not-too-random-looking from the complete chaos that comes from there.

So, what we do is define some search phrases, recursively search trough them, clean all of that and then make a huge randomized text out of them. With the 5 phrases I'm using right now, it takes some 15 minutes to complete, and by complete I mean hitting the Twitter API rate limit.

You can see an example 276.160 word novel generated with this script at http://contraculto.com/then-i-will

The code is small, simple and full of comments, should anybody want to look at it and play. Everything is WTFPL licensed. http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/
